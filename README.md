# EDA-ML_on_Analytics_Job_Prediction_dataset
This repository contains an EDA and ML analysis on the database from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv.

The main task was to understand and point out the reasons why employees were leaving a company.
At the end of the work, some suggestions were put forward.

Content of the .ipynb file: 
1- Exploratory Data analysis (EDA) to show which variables were directly impacting employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work);
2- Various plots (histograms, dispersion, heatmap, etc.) presenting relations and trends among variables;
3- A logistic regression model and a Random forest model to build and evaluate parameters through an evaluation matrix.

hr_rf1 and hr_rf1 contained the trained models.
